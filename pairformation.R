#### Pair-formation model of conjugation ####

#### Version history ####
# Before 9 January 2020 the equation for dR contained - kp*R*R instead of - 2*kp*R*R
# On 10 february 2020 I changed the equation of the nutrients to include washout of nutrients
# Later I changed kp, kn, gd, and gt to log10kp, log10kn, log10gd, and log10gt
# In version 9 (13 March 2020) I removed the biomass equations from the models. This has the
# advantage that the integration will be slightly faster since one equation less has to be
# integrated. More importantly, removing the biomass equation is needed to enable
# stability-analysis based on the eigenvalues of the jacobimatrix in the plasmid-free equilibrium
# On 13 March I also removed the plotting commands from the script and changed the structure of
# the output dataframe, to prevent repetition of the biomass and Dinit = plasmid-bearing bacteria at the initial state.
# For some versions there is a script available using rootSolve to run fast to equilibrium,
# e.g. PairFormationSimulation2rootSolve8, but no plot over time can be made and it does not always work,
# and the output structure is different from deSolve, leading to different selection styles for storing data
# in the dataframe.
# In version 13 I corrected the calculation of the eigenvalues to use the plasmid-free equilibrium EqFull, not
# the plasmid-free equilibrium with Dinit donors added to it (state). I also changed the calculation of the
# biomass at the initial state in the dataframe to a cleaner implementation.
# Version 13 is a copy of version 12, where I copied the script part by part to get the correct outlining
# of all the brackets, and I changed some comments and the order of some parts to get a clearer and cleaner
# script.
# In version 13 (?) added dots in the graphs to indicate the points where equilibrium was not reached.
# Besides, I splitted cSet and gSet in separate sets for D and T, and added Dinit as a set and adjusted the
# for-loops accordingly.
# In version 14 I added automated labelling of the facets, and changed the manual labelling of the x- and
# y-axis to automated labelling.
# Versions 15 - 17 exist in a version with complete pair-formation, and a version ('ChangedContact') where
# Zhong's model is followed regarding pair-formation, such that only Mdr and Mrt pairs are formed, and Mdt
# and Mtt pairs arise from conjugation
# In version 18 I changed the linestyles and linecolors to highlight the plasmid-free population in the same
# way as in the earlier versions of the 'complete' model.
# In version 19 I extended the root-function and added an eventfunction to set populations of bacteria that are
# smaller than a threshold to 0. I also added handling of ratios that are invalid when checking for coexistence.
# In version 21 I changed the order of equations to have nutrients as the first equation so nutrients 
# can be disregarded in the rootfunction by using state[-1] without having to call length(state) or
# length(state) + 1. Similarly I changed the order of the roots in the rootfunction, to have terminalroot = 1
# instead of length(state) + 1. I also changed the rootfunction by selecting for only the bacterial populations
# to trigger a root. After these changes I also changed mylty, mycol, and initial states to match the changed order.
# NOTE: this implementation of events was WRONG, because the nutrients were excluded from selection so the
# wrong states were put to 0. This issue was solved in later versions of version 21.
# In version 23 the calculation of the bulk-rates according to Zhong has been added,
# and gdbulk and gtbulk have been added to the parameters stored in the matrix.
# The root- and eventfunctions are now also incorporated into the bulk-conjugation model.
# The the bulk-conjugation model is ran using Zhong's bulk-conjugation rates, and
# the output is stored in the matrix as well. I have added the column ComplexEigVal
# to the matrix, which indicates if complex eigenvalues were present, and now only
# the real parts of the eigenvalues are stored. Previously all values in the matrix
# would have a complex +0i part added if a value with a complex part was stored,
# and the imaginary parts hamper other functions.
# In version 24 I changed to writing csv-files instead of xlsx files, changed the
# script such that, even if invasion with the pair-formation model is not possible,
# gdbulk and gtbulk are calculated, and stability-analysis of the plasmid-free
# equilibrium in the bulk-model (which I added) is performed.
# I also lowered extinctionthreshold to prevent the density of newly formed
# populations from being below the extinctionthreshold.
# In version 25 I changed NI from 1 to 10 (which has previously been used),
# to decrease simulation time. The plots were also updated, various new plots
# were added, and other colorscales were used.
# In version 26 I removed the loop for e, Mytmax, Mytstep, and smallchange.
# The values for kp and kn were changed to have integer values for log10(kp)
# and log10(kn) (they were seq(from = -10.5, to = -8.5, by = 0.5), but the graphs
# erroneously present it like they were -10, -9, ...) 
# The loops for kp and kn were moved to only change after the plasimd-free
# equilibrium has been calculated.  


#### To do ####
# Add reference section for references to help-files, powerpoints, publications etc.
# Try to write plotting function with vars to be plotted on x- and y-axis and in facets,
# difference between models or ratio between models as options.

# Add totalT bulk, totalR bulk etc at equilibrium to dataframe
# Run bulk-model for short time (same as short pair-model) and compare them
# to see if the bulk-conjugation parameter holds (automated analysis somehow)

# Remove more out of loop?
# The runs which reach tmax were finished very quickly when I ran them
# out of the loop (manually setting the variables to the right numbers).

# QUESTION: have the resources to be considered for stability analysis?
# Imran does exclude them from stability analysis?
# Since I am only interested in perturbations of the equilibrium by adding donors,
# can the stability analysis be simplified (by only looking at the eigenvectors
# (eigenvalue?) of the donor-equation?). See 'A Practical Guide to Ecological
# Modelling: Using R as a Simulation Platform', p. 229-230)

# The plasmid-free equilibrium is R* = (NI - (w/bR))/e, Nutr* = w/bR, D* = Trans* = 0
# with condition w < NI*bR (otherwise it becomes a cell-free equilibrium ?) and
# the stability of this equilibrium is determined by the following eigenvalue
# - ct*w - (gt*(w - NI*bR))/(bR*e), leading to gt > (bR*ct*e*w)/(NI*bR - w) as
# invasion criterion. THIS SUGGESTS THAT DONOR CHARACTERISTICS DO NOT PLAY A ROLE
# in determining invasion

# Define root-function and event-function
# If the root-argument is equal to 0, an event (as defined by the event-function)
# is triggered. See ?events and ?lsodar (both in the deSolve package) for
# background information and examples. 
# The first root becomes 0 if the sum of absolute rates of change is equal to the
# threshold smallchange, i.e., when equilibrium is nearly reached. This root is
# set as the terminal root, in order to terminate the integration if this occurs.
# The other roots are used to determine if any of the state variables is equal
# to the extinction threshold. If this occurs, the event function is called,
# which sets the states that are equal to threshold to zero, and the integration
# continues.
# NOTE that the NUTRIENTS are also in the root- and event-functions, so currently
# they would also be set to 0 if they fall below the threshold, which is undesirable.
# The nutrients can probably removed from the rootfunction by using state[-1] -
# extinctionthreshold, but attempts to remove them from events failed for events
# implemented as state2[state2[-1] < extinctionthreshold] <- 0 or state2[state2[-1]
# < extinctionthreshold] <- 0 because the index shifts if nutrients are below the
# threshold. Using state2[(state2[-1] < extinctionthreshold) + 1] <- 0 might work.
# Note that it is still possible to have bacterial densities lower than the
# threshold, if these populations are created from other populations at each
# timestep.

## Idee: in plaats van runnen met cd = c(0.01, 0.025, 0.05) en ct = c(0.01, 0.025, 0.05)
## en vervolgens met plotten cd ~ ct gebruiken voor facetten, kan ook runnen met
## cd = 0.025, ct = c(0.01, 0.025, 0.05) (dus kleiner dan, gelijk aan, groter dan)
## en zelfdde voor gd en gt, dus gd = 15, gt = 10, 15, 20.

## Andere mogelijk aanpak: subset data in 4 groepen:
## (1) SignDomEig < 0, time == 0 (geen invasie mogelijk, egale kleur want N/A)
## (2) SignDomEig > 0, time >= tmax, invasie mogelijk maar evenwicht niet bereikt,
## dus niet inkleuren maar omkaderen of anderszins markeren
## (3) SignDomEig > 0, time < tmax, PlasmidsEq < (tolerantie?) BioEq (evenwicht
## bereikt, populatie niet volledig plasmiddragend,
## kleurverloop op dit deel van populatie toepassen
## (4) SignDomEig > 0, time < tmax, PlasmidsEq == (tolerantie?) BioEq (evenwicht
## bereikt, populatie volledig plasmiddragend,
## egaal kleuren)


# (1) gaat vanzelf goed via default, want dan geldt PlasmidsEq = 0, dus
# log10(PlasmidsEq) = NA
# (2) is nu gemplementeerd om de grid cells with a dot te markeren, MAAR DAT
# NOG UIT kleurverloop dataset halen
# (3) is de interessante, ALLEEN DEZE IN KLEURSCHAAL OPNEMEN
# (4) is niet zo interessant, EGAAL KLEUREN EN UIT KLEURSCHAAL HALEN
